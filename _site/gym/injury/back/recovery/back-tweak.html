    <h2 id="this-post-first-appeared-on-an-earlier-vesion-of-this-blog-which-unfortunately-went-down-with-all-my-data">This post first appeared on an earlier vesion of this blog which unfortunately went down with all my data.</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, on the ides of March, as I was pulling my first rep on the deadlift, I felt a pop in my lower back then a sharp jolt of pain radiating from there. My first thought was ‘Oh snap! There goes all my progress!’ (Expression has been translated from a popular non-PG phrase).</p>

<p>I had recently watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/riq-DfDDimc?si=J7NlKaNTR4h8Q9vo">video</a> on back pain from one of my favorite youtuber’s, Allan Thrall, so I immediately followed his advice.
I set down the bar and started stretching my back; child’s pose, cat-cow and toe touches. I then did a couple of painful air squats then stopped the workout.
As soon as I got home I repeated the stretches and air squats; they were incredibly difficult. Walking was difficult, tying my shoelaces was excruciating, and twisting in my seat to get a pen was agonising. However, I did not despair. I knew that my back wasn’t that seriously hurt and the pain was just my brain trying its best to protect a pulled muscle so I ignored the pain as much as I could.</p>

<p>All day long I kept getting up and stretching my back as well as doing air squats and toe touches. If I needed to pick something up, I forced myself to bend over and do it rather than compensate with my knees. In the afternoon I went to see a chiropractor and he made some adjustments. At night I slept on the floor and on my side rather than my stomach as is my norm.</p>

<p>The next day my lower back still felt the need to test my resolve but I kept at it. I went to work as usual and did not complain about my back. I kept up with the stretching, squats and toe touches and had a second session with the chiropractor. By evening the tightness was beginning to melt away. I slept on the floor again.</p>

<p>On Friday morning I was back at the gym. I did my chin-ups properly with no issues then squats with the empty bar and progressed to 10 reps of 60kgs with just some soreness. I also did 60kg deadlifts, bench presses, overhead presses and dumbbell rows. I did all my compound lifts with sub-maximal weights to test my back and they all felt fine! As a precaution, I did them all with a belt. As I went about my day I kept up with the stretches and movements.</p>

<p>Monday morning I was in the gym and had resumed my program with no pain or soreness at all!
In conclusion; when you injure your lower back it probably won’t be a slipped disk or something serious like that. It’s most likely just a pulled muscle that feels painful and scary but if you face it head-on and don’t let it have a say, it will shrink and go away.</p>

<p>Remember, this is not medical advice, just my experience with a back tweak.</p>
